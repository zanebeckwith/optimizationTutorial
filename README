This is a tutorial created for the CAP-REU
(Computational Astronomy and Physics) program
at UNC-CH during the 
Summer of 2013. 

Author: Zane Beckwith

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce
undergraduate researchers to the 'flavor'
(a broad overview) of mathematical optimization.
This includes a brief overview of the field,
including (hopefully most of) its subfields,
and an extended 'play around' with a 
previously-coded Nelder-Mead ('Downhill Simplex')
example.

The tutorial is intended to be self-guided
and self-contained.
